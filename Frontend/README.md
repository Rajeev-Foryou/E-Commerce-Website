## Project Overview

UrbanCart is designed to be a fully functional e-commerce platform that allows users to register, log in, browse products, manage their shopping cart, and place orders. It leverages the MERN stack for both the backend and frontend development:

- **MongoDB** is used to store data.
- **Express.js** is used for building the REST API.
- **React.js** provides a responsive frontend.
- **Node.js** is used to run the server.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Setup and Basics

- **Understand the MERN stack**: Introduction to the key technologies.
- **GitHub Repository**: Set up the repository and summarize project details.
- **Environment Setup**: Install Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and VS Code.

### Milestone 2: Backend Development

- **User Authentication**: Implement registration and login functionality.
- **Product Management**: Develop CRUD operations for products (create, read, update, delete).
- **Order Handling**: Manage orders and transactions through APIs.
- **MongoDB Schemas**: Design schemas for users, products, and orders.
- **Middleware**: Create middleware for validation and error handling.

### Milestone 3: Frontend Development

- **React Setup**: Initialize the React project using `create-react-app` or Vite.
- **User Pages**: Build login, registration, and profile pages.
- **Product Pages**: Implement product listing, search, and details pages.
- **Order Pages**: Create cart, checkout, and order history pages.
- **State Management**: Use Redux or Context API for state management.
- **React Router**: Implement navigation across the app.

### Milestone 4: Integration, Testing, and Deployment

- **Frontend & Backend Integration**: Link the frontend with the backend through API calls.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Use tools like Postman to test the functionality.
- **Deployment**:
  - Backend: Deploy the server on platforms like Heroku, Render, or AWS.
  - Frontend: Deploy the React app on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
- **Security & Optimization**: Ensure the app is secure, optimized, and production-ready.
